Analyze the following problem and determine if it can be solved using machine learning.

CRITICAL: First determine if this is:
- A DISCUSSION/THEORETICAL POST about ML concepts, failures, or frameworks (NOT suitable for training)
- An ACTUAL ML PROBLEM that requires building/training a model (suitable for training)

Discussion posts to REJECT:
- Posts about "why ML fails", "correlation vs causation", "causal inference"
- Theoretical discussions about ML frameworks, paradigms, or concepts (e.g., Judea Pearl's Ladder of Causation)
- Research papers, analysis, or explanations
- Questions about ML concepts without asking for implementation
- Posts marked [D] or [Discussion]
- Posts discussing production ML failures, distribution shift, robustness
- Posts asking "curious if" or "wondering" about concepts

Actual ML problems to ACCEPT:
- Requests to build, train, or implement ML models
- Problems that need prediction, classification, or clustering
- Questions asking for help with specific ML tasks
- Problems that can be solved with a dataset and model training
- Clear action verbs: "build", "create", "develop", "implement", "train", "predict"

Problem:
{problem_text}

Evaluate:
1. Is this a discussion/theoretical post? (yes/no) - If yes, set feasible=false, task_type=none
2. Is this problem solvable using machine learning? (yes/no)
3. What type of ML task is this? (classification/regression/clustering/other/none)
4. What is the confidence level? (0.0 to 1.0)
5. Is a public dataset likely available? (yes/no/maybe)
6. What are the key features/variables needed?
7. What are potential challenges?

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
    "feasible": true/false,
    "task_type": "classification|regression|clustering|other|none",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "dataset_available": true/false/null,
    "key_features": ["feature1", "feature2"],
    "challenges": ["challenge1", "challenge2"],
    "reasoning": "brief explanation",
    "is_discussion": true/false
}}
